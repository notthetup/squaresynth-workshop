## Description

This is the material for a workshop on basic electronics teaching making of a basic analog square wave synth, based on a CD4093 Quad NAND IC.

The circuit can be implemented on a PCB using [this original design](http://lifepatch.org/Squaresynth_-_DIY_Electronic_Workshop) from [Lifepatch](http://lifepatch.org) or using breadboards.

## Resources

- Two types of schematics ([Fritzing](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/squaresynth.fzz) and [Eagle](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/squaresynth.sch)) of this square synth circuit can is included in this repo. You'll need to download the [Fritzing](http://fritzing.org/) and [EagleCAD](http://www.cadsoftusa.com/) to view them.

- A [jpg schematic](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/squaresynth_schem.jpg) is also included for reference.

- A [schematic of the Lifepatch PCB design is here](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/schematic.png)

- The [inner workings of the CD4093 IC can be found here](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/4093.png)

- You can find out more about the [CD4093 IC in it's datasheet](https://github.com/notthetup/squaresynth-workshop/blob/master/CD4093BC.pdf).
